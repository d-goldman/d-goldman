### <p align="center">Hope to one day see

  - I can imagine an application that is able to be given a problem and a set of
parameters, such as "I want to ensure the availability of a resource, and the 
available environment options are...' and will recommend possible configurations 
ranked from most to least [ optimal | expensive | etc ]. Then once an option is
chosen, the implementation is automated, and interesting metrics about the setup 
are monitored so that the configuration of an infrastructure is responsive to the 
ever-changing use of that infrastructure. I hope I get to work with something like 
that one day.
